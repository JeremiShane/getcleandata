Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Average of the mean and standard deviation measures by Subject and Activity
============================================================================

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in “mean_and_std_features.txt” which is reduced from the original “features.txt” file.

For the data “tidy_avg_mean_and_std_features.txt” the feature values described above and listed in “mean_and_std_features.txt” are averaged by subject_id and activity.

This codebook describes 
To obtain the average measures in “tidy_avg_mean_and_std_features.txt” we first reduce the original feature data set (see README.txt) to only mean and standard deviation measures, and then we average these measures by subject and activity.

Example: So if subject #1 were to have 10 feature rows for WALKING activity, our new file “tidy_avg_mean_and_std_features.txt” has only 1 row for (subject #1 and WALKING activity) and where all the column measures are now averages across 10 original rows for (subject #1 and WALKING activity).

The Activity column contains one of the following activities:
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

These activities are also found in the activity_label file provided with the original dataset.
